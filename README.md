# Interview Prep

This is my compilation of solved questions from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview". Each solution is written in Python and important lines are commented for clarity. I intend to solve at least 100 of the 189 questions before I graduate in December 2016.

Sublime and GitHub show different spacing for tabs, so all files have been tabbed to look flush on GitHub.

If you have any questions or comments about any of my solutions, feel free to email me at austin@angrydrop.net
