# Interview Prep

This is my compilation of solved questions from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview". Each solution is written in python and important lines are commented for clarity. I intend to solve all the questions before I graduate in December.

If you have any questions or comments about any of my solutions, feel free to email me at austin@angrydrop.net
