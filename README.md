# Interview Prep

This is a compilation of my solved questions from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview". Each solution is written in Python and important lines are commented for clarity.

Spacing from Windows to GitHub is a little wonky, so all files have been spaced to look flush on GitHub.

If you have any questions or comments about any of my solutions, feel free to email me at hello@austinthiel.com
